In real-time data processing systems, errors are inevitable. They can arise from invalid input data, network issues, insufficient permissions, or unexpected conditions in processing logic. If not handled properly, these errors can disrupt workflows, cause data loss, or produce inconsistent results.

In this context, error handling is particularly critical because the Lambda function processes data directly from the DynamoDB Stream. A single unhandled erroneous record can cause the system to retry processing or block subsequent events.

To ensure a stable and reliable system, AWS provides several error-handling mechanisms, such as:

+ Logging with CloudWatch – Store error details for analysis and resolution.
+ Retry and backoff mechanism – Automatically retry failed events with increasing delays.
+ Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) – Store repeatedly failed events for manual processing later.
+ Custom exception handling – Validate, filter, and transform data to avoid unnecessary errors.

By implementing these methods, the system can recover from errors, maintain data consistency, and reduce operational costs.
